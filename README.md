# Terra-YOLOv5-Classification-Model
 Terra is an object classification modeled designed to address the challenge of automatically classifying different types of garbage. Terra is deployed on a raspberry pi 4. 

In the realm of waste management, the accurate classification of garbage plays a pivotal role in enhancing recycling processes and reducing environmental impact. Despite advancements in waste sorting technologies, the challenge of efficiently categorizing diverse types of waste remains. A 2018 report indicated that in the United States alone, over 294.2 million tons of trash were generated, of which only about 30% was recycled. This inefficiency primarily stems from manual sorting processes that are labor-intensive and prone to error. The integration of artificial intelligence, particularly in object detection and classification, offers a transformative solution to this problem.			My project focuses on developing an object classification model using the YOLOv5m (You Only Look Once) framework, renowned for its effectiveness in real-time object detection. The model uses a single simple input source - images of garbage - to classify various types of waste. This simplification, however, does not diminish the complexity of the task, given the diverse and often ambiguous nature of waste items and their surrounding environments. The YOLOv5m model belongs to a family of YOLOv5 models, all of which vary in size. There is small, medium, large, and extra large. YOLOv5m lays in the sweet spot of these models and is a single-stage detector. We chose it for its balance between speed and accuracy. Single-stage detectors, in contrast to two-stage detectors like R-CNN, employ a single feed-forward network for both object localization and classification, making them more suitable for real-time applications. However, these models are still compute and memory intensive, posing challenges when deploying them on resource-constrained environments like the raspberry pi 4 4GB which Terra is ran on.	To address these challenges, I chose YOLOv5m instead of going for a more complex version like YOLOv5l. We also optimized and compressed our moddle by converting it to a Tflite model, which is designed for execution on embedded devices like the raspberry Pi. This approach is also aimed at optimizing the model for efficient execution without compromising accuracy.
